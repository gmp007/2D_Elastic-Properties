# 2D_Elastic-Properties
First-principles calculated elastic and mechanical properties of 2D materials and their heterostructures. 

In this project, we have used our recently developed ElasTool toolkit see code at https://github.com/zhongliliu/elastool with VASP as a calculator to compute using first-principles computations, the zero temperature and finite temperature (300 K) elastic and mechanical properties of several two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures. We developed a Machine-Learning algorithm to establish a correlation between the various computed properties.
